# 🚀 Gravitational Slingshot Simulator 🌍  

A real-time **gravitational slingshot** simulation built with **Pygame**! Launch a spacecraft and observe how gravity alters its trajectory as it interacts with a central planet.  

## 🌟 Features  
✅ **Gravity-Based Motion** – Objects accelerate towards the planet using Newtonian physics.  
✅ **Interactive Launch System** – Click to place the spacecraft, then click again to set its velocity.  
✅ **Dynamic Trajectories** – Watch objects slingshot around the planet or get pulled into collision.  
✅ **Realistic Orbital Mechanics** – Simulates acceleration, velocity changes, and gravitational forces.  
✅ **Collision & Boundary Detection** – Objects disappear upon impact or if they leave the screen.  

## 🎮 How to Play  
1️⃣ **Click anywhere** to set the spacecraft's starting position.  
2️⃣ **Click again** to launch it in the direction of your cursor.  
3️⃣ Observe how gravity influences the trajectory—will it escape, orbit, or crash?  

## 🔧 Installation  
Make sure you have Python installed, then install Pygame:  
```bash
pip install pygame
```  
Run the simulation:  
```bash
python slingshots_effect.py
```  

## 🚀 About the Physics  
This project simulates the **gravitational slingshot effect**, where a spacecraft gains or loses velocity by passing near a massive object. The force follows **Newton’s law of universal gravitation**, making the motion realistic and dynamic!  

🔭 Experiment with different launch angles and speeds to see how gravity shapes your spacecraft’s path!
